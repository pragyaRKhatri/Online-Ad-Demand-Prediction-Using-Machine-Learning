In this project, our goal is to predict the deal_probability using a machine learning model. Before that, we undertake various operations such as data cleaning and visualization to gain insights into the data. This helps us determine the essential factors that contribute to a successful deal_probability.

**Project Outline:**

- Download the dataset
- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Analysis and Visualization
- Prepare the dataset for ML training
- Train hardcoded & baseline models
- Make predictions
- Train & evaluate different models
- Tune hyperparameters for the best models
- Summary and References


**Conclusion**
- Examined and investigated the dataset thoroughly.
- Developed a basic model with fixed parameters to serve as a reference.
- Preprocessed the data to make it suitable for machine learning models.
- Created new features that were relevant and beneficial for the models.
- Trained multiple models and optimized their hyperparameters.
- The model I finalized achieved a Kaggle score of 0.24257.
